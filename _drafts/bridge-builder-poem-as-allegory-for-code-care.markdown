The poem in question ([source][poem-link]):

The Bridge Builder
by Will Allen Dromgoole

```
An old man going a lone highway,
Came, at the evening cold and gray,
To a chasm vast and deep and wide.
Through which was flowing a sullen tide
The old man crossed in the twilight dim,
The sullen stream had no fear for him;
But he turned when safe on the other side
And built a bridge to span the tide.

"Old man," said a fellow pilgrim near,
"You are wasting your strength with building here;
Your journey will end with the ending day,
You never again will pass this way;
Youâ€™ve crossed the chasm, deep and wide,
Why build this bridge at evening tide?"

The builder lifted his old gray head;
"Good friend, in the path I have come," he said,
"There followed after me to-day
A youth whose feet must pass this way.
This chasm that has been as naught to me
To that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be;
He, too, must cross in the twilight dim;
Good friend, I am building this bridge for him!"
```

Recently I have found myself enjoying reading the
[Art of Manliness blog][art-main-link].
An article that particularly stood out for me was
[Manvotional: The Bridge Builder][art-blog-link].
It talks of an experienced though weary traveller resolutely choosing to help
other less experienced travellers cross a turbulent river.
The river is of no danger to him but could be a disaster for others.

This has interesting parallels with software development.
The first steps of contributing to an established project can be a
significant barrier to entry like the turbulent river.
This can prevent new people from helping out with your projects unless
these steps are taken with the project:
* A simple readme that describes the purpose of the project.
* The code doesn't build straight out of source control.
* No unit or other automated tests to that show how the code should be used
  and proves it really does.
